This Project includes
1) Dagger2 for Dependency Injection
2) Butter Knife for Resolving Views
3) MVP architecture for Better Testability
4) Retrofit for Network API Calls
5) RxJava2 for Managing tasks on different threads
6) Glide for Loading Images efficiently

Possible Improvements with increased time and scope:
1) Creating a MVP structure for detail activity
2) Using fragments to implement Master-Detail Flow
3) Caching search terms to show a recently searched list
4) Using architecture components to make the app lifecycle aware
